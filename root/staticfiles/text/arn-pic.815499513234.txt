Meet Arin, probably the biggest UFC fan you'll meet in school. If he isn't trying to be the next Conor McGregor, you'll find him on the cricket pitch or in the library lamenting about his move to IB. He's an outgoing person who makes sure his work is up to the mark. Shy yet friendly, he loves starting new conversations with others. This master procrastinator gained a passion for space when he received Neil DeGrasse's book, "Astrophysics for people in a hurry", and since then, he's been hooked to anything space related. He hopes to capitalize on this opportunity and is ready to deliver for the club.
