An aspiring aerospace/aeronautical engineer, meet Trishir. His mind is a black hole of aviation and astronomical knowledge. When you see FlightRadar24 on his home screen, you know he's the head of Aviation. If he isn't immersed in exploring the cosmos, you can find him following MSD in cricket or Lewis Hamilton in Formula 1. According to his buddies, Trishir is very enthusiastic and fun, as evidenced by his sense of humour. He is an avgeek at heart and an avid plane spotter. If he's not watching planes, he's probably busy annihilating Atharva in a putt party.
