Going by many names, this is Jordan, a guy who biggest interests are in F1 (huge hamilton fan) and tennis. He found his love for aviation when he was 8 years old, when he decided he wanted to become a pilot when he grew up. Additionally, he is a massive foodie (you can always see him eating anywhere you go- when asked about his eating habits, his preferred reply is that he is on a bulk) He is fully committed, and will ensure he will give 100% to this club.
