Samidha is the most authentically genius person you'll ever come across, and her top two career choices include aeronautical, and space engineering. Apart from being a life-long cricket fan, F1 fan (currently suffering as a Mercedes fanatic) and “Sherlock” re-watcher, Sam spends her free time engulfed in reading novels. She's creative, and has an amazing design sense (no wonder why she's head of design in two different clubs). She's absolutely elated to be Head of Design for the Aviation and Astronomy Club 2023-24, and assures you aesthetically mind blowing designs for the rest of the year.
