From playing basketball for the school team to raging on chess games to grinding martial arts on Fridays to pestering his friends, Adhityan is a unique person. His mood lies at two ends of the spectrum: chill and carefree or "grind mindset activated." Adhityan is fascinated by SETI(Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) Project. Besides that, he spends countless nights wondering what he would say to his döppleganger from a parallel universe. With Adhityan at the helm, you can expect a journey filled with exploration, learning, and the joy of discovery in the captivating worlds of aviation and astronomy. The one quote he lives by, is “obsession is going to beat talent every time."
