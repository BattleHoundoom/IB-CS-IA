Aditya is one of the most flexible (not physically) and easy-going people you will ever find. He instinctively overthinks and procrastinates but always ensures the quality of his work. He loves hanging around with his friends regardless of whether it is due to studies, sports or just to waste time. Being a good communicator and having a “Do or Die” mindset has helped him over time on his journey to become HIM. If you want to talk to someone about anything, just hit him up! All he asks is for you to enjoy being part of this club and all that aviation and astronomy have to offer!
